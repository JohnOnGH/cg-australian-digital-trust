#### Summary 
The meeting focused on the establishment and future activities of the Australian Digital Trust Community Group, with discussions on the agenda for upcoming innovation days, the formation of subgroups, and the need for increased participation. The team also discussed the official establishment of the group, the process of joining, and the differences between working groups and community groups. Lastly, they addressed the challenges of engaging government representatives, the need for clear next steps, and the importance of recording their meetings for future reference.

**Building Digital Trust in Australia**
David Hyland, the host of the Australian Digital Trust Community Group meeting, began the session by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land and expressing his hope for the group to be a dedicated space for collaboration, transparency, and shared responsibility in building digital trust in Australia. He explained the group's genesis from a conversation following Nab's innovation days, which focused on digital identity and trust, and the need for increased collaboration between public and private sectors. The group aims to achieve this through two broad activity types: topical discussions and the continuation and expansion of Nab's innovation days. The goal is to ensure digital trust in Australia is built on collaboration, transparency, and shared responsibility, and to reach across industries, communities, and cultures to ensure Australia is at the forefront of digital trust.

#### Next Steps

1. All co-chairs to encourage community members to sign the participation agreement.
2. Mike to process pending participation agreements.
3. Gareth to follow up with new participants to ensure they have access to Slack and the mailing list.
