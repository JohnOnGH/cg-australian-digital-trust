# Welcome to the Australian Digital Trust Community Group.

I would like to begin our first community group meeting by acknowledging the Traditional Custodians of the lands on which we are all meeting from today. For those of us in Sydney, that is the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation. I pay my respects to their **Elders past, present, and emerging,** and extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples joining us from across the country.
 
Australia is a nation of many cultures, industries, and communities. How we preserve this diversity while building digital trust is a challenge none of us can solve alone.
 
At the heart of this challenge is a shared vision for digital trust— one that ensures our diverse communities, industries, and institutions can operate with confidence in this increasingly digital world.
 
Before we dive in further – I wanted to provide a little context up front.
 
This community group was born from a simple yet powerful realization **digital trust is bigger than any one organization, sector, or initiative**.
 
It started as a conversation between a few of us after one of NABs Innovation Days.  These Innovation Days – which were focused on digital identity and trust – **brought together a wide range of individuals** to explore problem statements and possible solutions to the trust gap across the Australian digital economy.
 
The timing of this conversation followed **Australia’s Digital Identity legislation receiving Royal Assent**, marking a critical milestone in our national journey, **and we were all aware of the incredible potential for real progress**. At the same time, we were conscious of the risk of fragmentation between the public and private sectors – and the need for increased collaboration.
 
Through our involvement in initiatives like the **Consumer Data Right (CDR) and ConnectID**, and contributions to **OpenID Foundation working groups**, we’ve seen firsthand the power of collaboration — organizations that typically compete **coming together to solve shared challenges.**
 
Yet, those conversations **were often confined** to banks, fintechs, and government.

So, it became clear that **Australia needed a dedicated space** — one where industry, government, and the broader community could come together to define, debate, and hopefully shape the future of digital trust.
 
**This Community Group is that home** — a place where we can work together to ensure digital trust in Australia is **built on collaboration, transparency, and shared responsibility.**
 
We will achieve this goal with two broad activity types.
 
**The first of these is through topical discussion** - this is where we really want input from you. What issues – both business and technical  - do we need to focus on to ensure interoperability between the choice of consumer facing services that are emerging in Australia and globally.
 
**The second activity is a continuation and expansion of NAB’s Innovation Days which were pioneered by Brad Carr.** These Innovation Days will be at the heart of our outreach — a way to **engage with industry, government, and the wider community** to ensure that the national conversation on digital trust is as inclusive, thoughtful, and forward-looking as possible.

Through the **Innovation Days series and topical working groups**, we will expand the conversation — reaching across industries, communities, and cultures to **ensure Australia is at the forefront of digital trust.**
 
**Digital trust isn’t just a technical issue** — it’s about building confidence in our digital economy, protecting privacy, preventing fraud, and ensuring fair access to services.
 
And ultimately, it will define Australia’s role in the global digital landscape.
 
The future of digital trust **shouldn’t be shaped by one objective, one company, or one sector alone.** Through this group, we have an opportunity to work together — **across industries, across sectors, and across communities **— to build a **shared foundation** for trust in Australia’s digital economy.
 
Welcome to the Australian Digital Trust Community Group.

Let’s get started.
